I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/steveebenezer">Steve</a>, and this is my blog. I mostly write (boring, usable, meaningful) software everyday or every other day, I also enjoy doing other stuff like making music, cook and randomly binge watch restoration videos, how-to’s that I won’t do’s and Gordon Ramsay bursting out at people just because he can.

This will be my personal space, and I’ll be posting an article every week about what I’ve learned or noticed interesting about software, food, music, software, food,… you know 🤷🏾‍♂️

Thanks for stopping by, subscribe to my RSS feed if you’d like to be kept updated, and feel free to say hi, I’ll get back with replies asap ☕️

(Topics you can expect in this blog: Software systems, Algorithms, JavaScript, SASS/CSS, Ruby, ReScript/ReasonML and anything random I find interesting)
